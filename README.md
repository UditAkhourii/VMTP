# Deeptrain

## What is Deeptrain?

Deeptrain is a multi-modal data connector designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents. Our platform enables you to source and integrate data that is not natively accessible or interpretable by transformer models and AI systems.

## Multi-modal Capabilities

Deeptrain empowers the creation of truly multi-modal applications, allowing your AI agents to learn and interact with content beyond the current processing limitations of existing LLMs.

### Text
- Train and customize your AI agents to operate beyond predefined context window limitations.
- Utilize a localized embedding database that retrieves real-time content from live data sources to enhance your AI's responses.

### Images
- Seamlessly integrate computer vision into non-vision-supported models, turning them into fully functional computer-vision-enabled LLMs.

### Flowcharts and Graphs
- Equip your AI to understand flowcharts, graphs, diagrams, and similar visual content through Deeptrain's advanced integration capabilities.

### Audio
- Process and leverage audio content for training and enhancing your AI agents.

### Videos
- **New Feature**: Deeptrain now supports multi-dimensional video processing! 
  - Use videos from local storage, self-hosted platforms, or popular platforms like Vimeo and YouTube to expand your AI's knowledge.
  - Accept video inputs directly from users through Deeptrain's **Transcribe API**, enabling transcription and processing for use in AI training.
